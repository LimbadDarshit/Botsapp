# BotsApp - Web Chat Application

**BotsApp** is a fully PHP-based web chat application designed for seamless individual and group communication. It allows users to send and receive messages in real-time, using a hybrid approach of polling and notifications. This project was created as part of a 5th semester academic requirement and showcases a simple, functional alternative to socket-based chat systems. 

Everyone was saying that you can't build a chat application without using Socket.IO or WebSockets along with a backend server, so I decided to take on the challenge and completed the project! ðŸ˜Š

I addressed many security issues along the way, though Iâ€™m aware there are still potential vulnerabilities. But you know what? I'm just focused on making sure it runs smoothly until my teachers give me full marks.

## Features

- **Individual and Group Chat:** Users can engage in both private and group conversations.
- **Message Notifications:** Notifications are sent to all participants in a group when someone sends a message.
- **Polling Mechanism:** Utilizes polling for retrieving new messages, ensuring updates are checked regularly without the need for continuous connections.
- **PHP Backend:** Fully built on PHP, without reliance on Socket.IO or other real-time communication frameworks.
- **MySQL Database:** Stores user information and chat logs securely using MySQL.
- **File and Image Sharing**
   - Users can share files and images within the chat, making communication more versatile and interactive.
- **Custom Emoji Uploads**
   - Users have the ability to upload their own emojis in three ways:
     - **Private:** Emojis are available only to the individual user who uploaded them.
     - **Public:** Emojis are available to all users across the platform.
     - **Group:** Emojis are available to users within a specific group.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (AJAX)
- **Backend:** PHP
- **Database:** MySQL
