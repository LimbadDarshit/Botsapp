# BotsApp - Web Chat Application

![Image betrayed me ðŸ˜’](img/logo.png)

**BotsApp** is a fully PHP-based web chat application designed for seamless individual and group communication. It allows users to send and receive messages in real-time, using a hybrid approach of polling and notifications. This project was created as part of a 5th semester academic requirement and showcases a simple, functional alternative to socket-based chat systems. 

Everyone was saying that you can't build a chat application without using Socket.IO or WebSockets along with a backend server, so I decided to take on the challenge and completed the project! ðŸ˜Š

I addressed many security issues along the way, though Iâ€™m aware there are still potential vulnerabilities. But you know what? I'm just focused on making sure it runs smoothly until my teachers give me full marks.

## Features

- **Individual and Group Chat:** Users can engage in both private and group conversations.
- **Message Notifications:** Notifications are sent to all participants in a group when someone sends a message.
- **Polling Mechanism:** Utilizes polling for retrieving new messages, ensuring updates are checked regularly without the need for continuous connections.
- **PHP Backend:** Fully built on PHP, without reliance on Socket.IO or other real-time communication frameworks.
- **MySQL Database:** Stores user information and chat logs securely using MySQL.
- **File and Image Sharing**
   - Users can share files and images within the chat, making communication more versatile and interactive.
- **Custom Emoji Uploads**
   - Users have the ability to upload their own emojis in three ways:
     - **Private:** Emojis are available only to the individual user who uploaded them.
     - **Public:** Emojis are available to all users across the platform.
     - **Group:** Emojis are available to users within a specific group.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (AJAX)
- **Backend:** PHP
- **Database:** MySQL

## Installation

To set up and run BotsApp on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/darshitlimbad/BotsApp.git
    ```

2. **Set Up the Database:**
   - Create two new MySQL databases.
   - Import the provided `botsapp.sql` and `botsapp_statusdb.sql` file to set up the necessary tables.

3. **Configure the Project:**
   - Update the `functionality\db\env.php` file with your database credentials. (please provide your REcaptcha code ðŸ¤¨)
   - Enable sodium extention if it is not enabled.

4. **Change the document root**
   - Go to your `http.conf` and change the document root to `botsapp` folder. 

5. **Start the Server:**
   - Run BotsApp on a local development server like XAMPP or WAMP for Windows, or LAMP for Linux.

6. **Access BotsApp:**
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost` to start using the application.

## Future Enhancements

- **Real-time Chat:** Moving from a polling-based system to a real-time WebSocket-based solution.
- **User Authentication:** Enhanced security features with password hashing (Using sodium) and secure login.
- **UI Improvements:** Improve the front-end design for a better user experience.
- **Mobile Optimization:** Make the chat app fully responsive and mobile-friendly.

## `postReq(url, data, options)`

### Description

The `postReq` function is a custom AJAX utility that provides a standardized way to send asynchronous HTTP requests to the BotsApp server. It simplifies data communication and offers advanced features like progress tracking and request cancellation.

### Parameters

- **`url`:** (String) The URL of the target server-side endpoint. For example, `/functionality/lib/_chat.php`.
- **`data`:** (Object or String) Data to be sent with the request. This is usually JSON-encoded data for POST requests.
- **`options`:** (Object)  An optional object for customizing the request behavior. See table below for available options.

### Options Table

| Option                 | Type        | Description                                                                                        |
|--------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `method`               | String      | The HTTP method to use (e.g., "POST" by default or "GET").                                             |
| `async`                | Boolean     | Whether the request should be asynchronous (true by default).                                            |
| `Content_Type`          | String      | The content type of the request data (e.g., 'application/json' by default).                              |
| `onUploadProgress`     | Function    | Callback function for progress updates during file uploads. It receives a `Progress` object.        |
| `onDownloadProgress`    | Function    | Callback function for progress updates during file downloads. It receives a `Progress` object.       |
| `onDOwnloadAbortXMLOrNot` | Function    | Callback function to determine if the download should be aborted.                                   |
| `onUploadAbortXMLOrNot` | Function    | Callback function to determine if the upload should be aborted.                                   |


### Return Value

- **Promise:**  The `postReq` function returns a Promise that resolves with an object containing:
    - **`status`:** (String) "success" for a successful request, "error" for an error, or "abort" for an aborted request.
    - **`responseText`:** (String)  The server's response text. If the response is in JSON format, it is parsed into a JavaScript object.

### Example Usage

```javascript
// Send a POST request to the chat endpoint
postReq('/functionality/lib/_chat.php', JSON.stringify({ req: 'sendMsg', msg: 'Hello!' }))
    .then(response => {
        if (response.status === 'success') {
            console.log('Message sent successfully:', response.responseText);
        } else {
            console.error('Error sending message:', response.error);
        }
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error:', error);
    });
```

#### `Progress` Class

### Description

The `Progress` class provides a convenient structure for accessing progress information during file uploads and downloads. It contains information about the amount of data loaded, the total size, and whether the operation is complete.

### Properties

- **`done`:** (Boolean)  Indicates whether the operation is complete (`true`) or not (`false`).
- **`loaded`:** (Number) The amount of data that has been loaded so far.
- **`total`:** (Number) The total size of the data being transferred.
- **`timeStamp`:** (Number) The timestamp of the progress event.

### Example Usage

```javascript
const onUploadProgress = (progress) => {
    let progressPR = document.querySelector(".progressPR");
    progressPR.textContent = Math.ceil(progress.loaded * 100 / progress.total) + "%";
    
    if (progress.done) {
        progressPR.remove();
    }
};
```
